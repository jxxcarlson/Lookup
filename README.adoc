== Introduction

*Lookup* is a command-line program for interacting with a database of notes.
A note consists of two fields: title and contents, e.g.,

----
  Title: Speed of light
  Contents: 300,000 km/sec
----

Once everything is properly set up, you can add records like this:

----
  $ lu -a Speed of light:: 300,000 km/sec
----

If the entry is long, just keep typing. Type `<return>` when finished.

To search for a note by title, imitate this example:

----
  $ lu -t speed
----
